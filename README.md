# Military Aircraft Detection Using YOLO

## Overview 

This project involves building a YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to identify and classify different types of military aircraft. The model is trained on the Military Aircraft Detection Dataset, which contains images and annotations of various military aircraft types.

Our goal is to develop a robust and efficient object detection model capable of detecting multiple aircraft types in an image with high accuracy, while leveraging the YOLO architecture for real-time performance.


## Data
